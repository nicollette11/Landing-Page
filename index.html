            <h2><p>Political News:</p></h2>The Impeachment of President Donald Trump
            In early 2020, the United States witnessed the impeachment 
            trial of President Donald Trump on charges of abuse of power 
            and obstruction of Congress. Though acquitted by the Senate, 
            the event marked only the third time in U.S. history that a president faced impeachment, 
            highlighting deep divisions within the country.

            <h2><p>Entertainment News:</p></h2> The Rise of Streaming Services
            Over the past few years, streaming services like Netflix, 
            Hulu, and Disney+ have revolutionized the way we consume entertainment. 
            The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this trend, with more people than ever 
            binge-watching shows and movies from the comfort of their homes.

            <h2><p>Science News:</p></h2> COVID-19 Vaccines
            One of the most significant scientific achievements in recent years 
            was the rapid development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. 
            Companies like Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca produced effective 
            vaccines in record time, offering a glimmer of hope in the fight 
            against the pandemic.

            <h2><p>Throwback:<p></h2> Music in the Early 2000s and '90s
            The late '90s and early 2000s were a golden era for music, spanning 
            a range of genres from grunge to hip-hop to pop. Artists like 
            Britney Spears, NSYNC, and Eminem dominated the charts and airwaves. 
            The decade also gave rise to iconic bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam, 
            whose influence can still be felt today. These periods were marked by 
            the rise of MTV and the importance of music videos, setting the stage 
            for the digital age of music that would follow.
